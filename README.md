# Lindquist-Wheeler

C++ code for simulating photons propagating through Lindquist-Wheeler cosmologies and measuring the resulting redshifts.

Each folder has a main.cpp file for running on a local machine and a main_parallelised.cpp file for running parallelised on a cluster.

Simulation parameters are stored in params.cfg files. These are to be redirected via bash into main.cpp or main_parallelised.cpp.
